# CDENet: Crowd Density Estimation Network

CDENet is a deep learning model designed for crowd count detection tasks. It utilizes a modified VGG16 architecture with 10 layers and incorporates dilated convolutions in the backend to improve accuracy in dense crowd scenarios.

## Overview
Crowd count detection is a crucial task in various domains such as urban planning, security surveillance, and event management. CDENet offers a robust solution by accurately estimating crowd density in images or videos, enabling better crowd management and analysis.

## Key Features
- **VGG16 Architecture:** CDENet is built upon the widely used VGG16 architecture, which has shown effectiveness in various computer vision tasks.
- **10-Layer Modification:** To adapt VGG16 for crowd count detection, CDENet modifies the original architecture to have 10 layers, optimizing it for density estimation.
- **Dilated Convolutions:** In the backend layers, CDENet incorporates dilated convolutions to capture contextual information over larger receptive fields, improving accuracy, especially in densely packed crowd scenarios.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** CDENet is implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, allowing for easy integration into existing workflows.
- **Pre-Trained Weights:** Pre-trained weights are available, facilitating transfer learning for crowd count detection tasks with limited labeled data.
